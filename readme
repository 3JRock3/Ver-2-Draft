# Tennessee Draft Board (Vite + React + TS)

This repo contains a **fully working** fantasy draft dashboard:
- CSV **Import/Export**
- Strategy sliders (QB/RB/WR/TE, rookie boost, risk aversion, upside, ADP anchor, offense bonus)
- Live pick tracking (Taken/To Me), Undo, Reset
- Snake math + Round Builder
- Autosaves to your browser

## How to run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open the printed URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

## How to use from GitHub
- Upload this whole folder to a **new GitHub repo**.
- In CodeSandbox, choose **"Import from GitHub"** and select your repo.
- It will install deps and run automatically.

## CSV format
Required: `name,pos,adp`  
Optional: `team,age,rookie,injuryRisk,upside,offense,bye`  
Values:
- `pos` ∈ {QB,RB,WR,TE}
- `adp`: number (lower = earlier)
- `rookie`: true/false, yes/no, 1/0
- `injuryRisk`, `upside`: 0–1 (e.g., 0.18, 0.95)
- `offense`: 1–5 (1 = elite)

## Notes
This version uses only basic HTML controls (no external UI kits), so it runs anywhere with zero extra setup. You can later swap in your shadcn/ui version if you prefer that styling.
